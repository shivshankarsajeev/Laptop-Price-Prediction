# Laptop-Price-Prediction

•	Developed an end-to-end machine learning project to predict laptop prices based on various configurations (e.g., brand, RAM, GPU, screen size) using multiple regression algorithms.

•	Performed feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning, identifying that Random Forest Regressor provided the best performance with an R2 score of 88.7.

•	Deployed the model through a Streamlit web app, enabling users to input laptop configurations and receive real-time price predictions.
